Decoding executive functions from MEG neural oscillations in childhood

Executive Functions (EFs) represent a set of cognitive top-down processes involved in self-
regulation and goal-oriented behaviour. EFs are classified in lower-order components, such as
working memory, task shifting and early reward inhibition, and higher-order ones, such as
planning and problem-solving. These processes typically recruit the prefrontal cortex and
secondary subcortical areas [1]. Previous research has found that information conveyed in
certain EF tasks may be encoded by specific classes of neural oscillations, or frequency bands,
which can be quantified with neuroimaging techniques such as magnetoencephalography
(MEG) [2]. However, it is unclear yet whether certain neural oscillations drive the development
of EFs and whether sex plays a modulatory role in such processes. To address this gap, we aim
to study the contributions of MEG-derived neural oscillations to EF task performance in the
SAM children cohort [3]. For this purpose, a decoding model will be trained to predict EF
performance from neural activity. Results will help identify critical contributors of EF
development and clarify their role in different sex and age groups.
